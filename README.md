# 🛠️ Product Management CRUD API

A simple and scalable **full-stack Node.js API** that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products. Built with **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose**, the app follows a modular structure with clean separation of concerns.

---

## ✨ Features

* 🔄 **CRUD Functionality**: Create, read, update, and delete products.
* 🔗 **MongoDB Integration**: Built with Mongoose for schema modeling and DB interaction.
* 🌐 **RESTful API**: Clean, semantic, and consistent endpoints.
* 🔐 **Environment Config**: Secure configuration using `.env` for sensitive variables.
* ⚠️ **Error Handling**: Unified, expressive error responses across all endpoints.
* 🚀 **Modular Architecture**: Separate controllers, models, and routes for clarity and scalability.

## 🧪 API Endpoints

All routes are prefixed with: `/api/product`

| Method | Route  | Description          |
| ------ | ------ | -------------------- |
| GET    | `/`    | Get all products     |
| GET    | `/:id` | Get a product by ID  |
| POST   | `/`    | Create a new product |
| PUT    | `/:id` | Update a product     |
| DELETE | `/:id` | Delete a product     |

---

## 📦 Product Schema

Each product in the database contains the following fields:

* `name` (String, required)
* `quantity` (Number, required, default: 0)
* `price` (Number, required, default: 0)
* `image` (String, optional URL)
* `createdAt`, `updatedAt` (Automatically generated by Mongoose)

## ⚙️ How to Use

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file and add your MongoDB connection string:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will be available at:
**[http://localhost:3000/api/product](http://localhost:3000/api/product)**

---

## 📬 Example Request

### ➕ Create a Product

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/product \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "MacBook Pro",
    "quantity": 5,
    "price": 1999.99,
    "image": "https://example.com/macbook.jpg"
  }'
```

## 🧠 What I Built

* ✅ Created a clean and maintainable backend API for managing products.
* ✅ Applied modular principles by separating logic into routes, controllers, and models.
* ✅ Used **Mongoose** for schema definition, validation, and MongoDB interaction.
* ✅ Configured **dotenv** to securely manage environment variables.
* ✅ Designed for extensibility (authentication, more models, frontend integration, etc.).

---

## 🛠️ Development Notes

* Written using **ES Modules** (`"type": "module"` in `package.json`)
* Uses **Nodemon** for live reloading during development (`npm run dev`)
* Includes structured **error handling** for robustness
* `.env` and `node_modules` are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`

---

## 🚧 Future Improvements

This backend is a solid foundation for expansion. Some ideas:

* 🔐 Add user authentication (JWT)
* 🎨 Build a React or TypeScript frontend
* 📜 Add unit and integration tests
* 📊 Add filtering, pagination, and sorting on product listings
